# Individual Homework Assignment 1: Text Analysis with Twitter Mining and Document Distance Comparing

## Part 1: Twitter Mining and Visualizations (Wordclouds in Python, Wordle, and Tableau)

1) Create Python3 code `TwitterCollectionAPI.py` that asks the User to enter a hashtag word (such as #stockmarket). Also ask the User how many Tweets to collect with the max set to 30. Error check appropriately, in case the User enter Stockmarket with out the #.  
2) Create a file that stores the raw tweets `file_rawtweets.txt` `file.txt` `wordcloud.txt` `tableau.txt`.  
3) Using the data from the Tweets file, use or create a tokenizer. Create a file that contains relevant words (so not words like "and", "or", "the", etc). Include the word count for each of your relevant words `TwitterMiningWordCloud.py`.  
4) From the relevant words (and counts) file, create a wordcloud using Python3 `python.png`, a wordcloud using Tableau `tableau.png`, and wordcloud using Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) `wordle.png`.

## Part 2: Comparing Novels

Comparing Books via Text and Visualizing the Comparison

Create Python 3 code `ComparingNovels.py` that generates three visualizations (2D `2d.png`, 3D `3d.png`, and Hierarchical Cluster `ward.png`).
